//! The nodes a solid is made of, and how they refer to each other.
//!
//! ```text
//! Body ─► Lump ─► Shell ─► Face ─► Loop ─► Coedge ─► Edge ─► Vertex
//!                          │                 │
//!                          └► Surface        └► the coedge on the far side
//! ```
//!
//! A **lump** is one connected piece of solid; a body with two lumps is two
//! separate solids that a single operation produced. A **shell** is one
//! closed surface bounding a lump — a hollow cube is one lump with two
//! shells, an outer and an inner. A **face** is a bounded patch of one
//! surface; its **loops** are the rings that bound it, the first enclosing
//! and the rest cutting holes. A **coedge** is one face's use of an **edge**,
//! so a manifold edge has exactly two, one per side.
//!
//! # Why a coedge is not just a directed edge
//!
//! It records which way its loop traverses the edge, which is what makes a
//! face's boundary orientable and therefore what makes "inside" mean
//! anything. Two faces sharing an edge traverse it in opposite senses; when
//! they do not, the solid is inside out, and that is a thing
//! [`Body::validate`] can say rather than something a boolean discovers by
//! producing nonsense.
//!
//! # Why loops hold a `Vec` and not a linked ring
//!
//! ACIS links coedges into a ring with next and previous pointers, which
//! buys O(1) splicing on a loop of any size. Loops here are small — a face
//! with more than a dozen coedges is unusual and one with thousands does not
//! occur — and a `Vec` in traversal order has one ordering rather than two
//! that must be kept agreeing. Where a boolean would splice, it rebuilds.
//!
//! # Why an edge does not name its partner
//!
//! An edge holds the coedges that use it, and a coedge's partner is the other
//! one. Storing the partnership on both sides as well would be a second copy
//! of the same fact, and the two copies would eventually disagree.
