//! Whether a point is inside a solid.
//!
//! The question a boolean asks of every piece it has cut: this fragment of a
//! face — does it lie inside the other solid, outside it, or on its surface?
//! Union keeps what is outside, intersection what is inside, difference one
//! of each. Everything else about a boolean is bookkeeping around that
//! answer.
//!
//! # By counting crossings
//!
//! A ray from the point crosses a closed surface an odd number of times if it
//! started inside and an even number if it started outside. That is the whole
//! method, and its accuracy is entirely a matter of counting honestly.
//!
//! # Where counting is not honest
//!
//! A ray that grazes an edge, passes through a vertex, or runs along a face
//! crosses at a place where "how many times" has no answer — one face's hit
//! and its neighbour's are the same point, and counting them as two flips the
//! result. Rather than perturb the geometry, the count is attempted along
//! several directions and the first one that lands cleanly is taken. A point
//! that defeats all of them is reported as [`Containment::Unknown`], which a
//! boolean can refuse; guessing would put a hole in a solid.
//!
//! The same shape as [`geom2d::contains`](crate::geom2d::contains), for the
//! same reasons.
