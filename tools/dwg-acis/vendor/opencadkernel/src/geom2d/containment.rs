//! Nearest points, and what is inside what.
//!
//! Two questions that look unrelated and share their machinery. Snapping asks
//! the first — where on this curve is the cursor, how far. Hit testing,
//! selection and hatch filling ask the second — is this point inside that
//! boundary.
//!
//! Both are answered from the curve dispatch rather than by sampling. Nearest
//! points come from [`Curve::parameter_at`] pulled back into the curve's own
//! extent; containment comes from casting a ray and counting what it crosses,
//! which reuses the intersection dispatch and so inherits its exactness.
