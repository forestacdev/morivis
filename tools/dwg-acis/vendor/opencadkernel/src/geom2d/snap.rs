//! The points a curve offers to snap to.
//!
//! A snapper has two halves and they belong in different places. Deciding
//! *which* curve the cursor is near is a screen-space question — the tolerance
//! is in pixels, only what is visible can be picked, and in a rotated view
//! "near" means near on screen rather than in the drawing. That half stays with
//! the application.
//!
//! Deciding *where* on that curve is this half, and it has to come from the
//! curve rather than from a polyline standing in for it. The centre of a circle
//! is not a vertex of its tessellation; the perpendicular foot on an arc is not
//! the perpendicular foot on one of its chords. At twenty segments per radian a
//! chord sits about `3e-4 · r` from the arc, which on a hundred-metre radius is
//! thirty centimetres of snapping to the wrong place — and it moves when the
//! view is zoomed, so the same pick twice gives two answers.
