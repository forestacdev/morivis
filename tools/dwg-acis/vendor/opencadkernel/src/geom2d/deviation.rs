//! Sampling a curve to a chord tolerance rather than to a fixed density.
//!
//! [`Curve::tessellate`](super::Curve::tessellate) asks for so many segments
//! per radian, which is a look-and-feel figure: it produces the same polyline
//! for a circle a millimetre across and one the size of a city block. That is
//! fine for a preview and wrong for a drawing, where what matters is how far
//! the chord departs from the curve in the units the drawing is in — and, on
//! screen, how far that is in pixels.
//!
//! So the question this module answers is the other one: *given that no chord
//! may sag more than `tolerance` away from the curve, where are the points?*
//! A small circle gets its floor of segments and a large one gets as many as
//! it needs, from the same call.
//!
//! # How each kind is bounded
//!
//! For a circular arc the answer is closed form. A chord spanning angle `θ`
//! on a circle of radius `r` sags by `r(1 − cos(θ/2))`, so the largest step
//! that stays inside the tolerance is `θ = 2·acos(1 − tolerance/r)`.
//!
//! An ellipse has no single radius, and its parameter is not an angle, so
//! the closed form does not carry over — a step of `Δt` covers a different
//! amount of arc depending on where it is taken. What does hold for any
//! parameterisation is that a chord spanning `Δt` departs from the curve by
//! at most `‖P″‖·Δt²/8`, which for an ellipse bounds the step at
//! `√(8·tolerance/major)`. It over-samples the flatter stretches, which is
//! the safe direction to be wrong in, and on a circle it agrees with the
//! closed form to within a segment.
//!
//! A NURBS curve has neither, and is cut by subdivision instead: a span is
//! kept whole while its midpoint lies within the tolerance of its own chord,
//! and halved when it does not. That measures the actual departure rather
//! than bounding it, so a spline is cut finely exactly where it bends.
