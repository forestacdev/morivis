//! NURBS curves.
//!
//! A spline arrives from a drawing as a degree, a knot vector, control points
//! and — if it is rational — a weight per control point. Evaluating it is de
//! Boor's algorithm, which is short and exact, so there is no reason for this
//! to be the one curve the kernel can only approximate.
//!
//! # Weights are not optional
//!
//! Dropping the weights and evaluating a rational curve as though it were
//! polynomial is a quiet, plausible-looking wrong answer: the curve still
//! passes near its control points and still looks like a spline, but conic
//! sections written as NURBS — which is how a great many CAD circles and
//! ellipses arrive once they have been through a modeller — come out visibly
//! off. Weights are carried here and applied in homogeneous coordinates.
