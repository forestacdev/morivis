//! Turning a heap of segments into the regions they enclose.
//!
//! Given segments that cross each other anywhere — not just at their ends —
//! this finds every bounded region they close off. It is what answers "the
//! user clicked inside this shape, what is the shape" for a hatch, and it is
//! the same question a B-rep boolean asks in a face's `(u, v)` space once the
//! intersection curves have been projected into it: the two surfaces' loops
//! and the new curves cut each other up, and what comes out is a set of
//! regions to keep or discard.
//!
//! # How
//!
//! Three stages, each with a reason it cannot be skipped.
//!
//! **Split.** Every crossing becomes a vertex, so segments only ever meet end
//! to end afterwards. Found by a sweep over the less congested axis: sorting
//! by one coordinate and keeping an active list turns the all-pairs test into
//! an output-sensitive one, which matters because a drawing's segments are
//! usually spread out and rarely all overlap.
//!
//! **Weld.** Endpoints that land within tolerance of each other become one
//! vertex. Without this a boundary that *looks* closed on screen has a gap of
//! a rounding in it and no face is found at all — the single most common way
//! this kind of search fails.
//!
//! **Trace.** Each undirected edge is two directed half-edges. Walking one and
//! always taking the next neighbour clockwise around the far vertex traces
//! exactly one face, and every half-edge belongs to exactly one. The traversal
//! that comes back clockwise is the unbounded outside, which is why the
//! orientation is what selects the bounded ones.
//!
//! # Tolerance
//!
//! Passed in rather than fixed here. What counts as "the same point" depends
//! on what produced the segments — a tessellation's own chord tolerance, a
//! drawing's units, a face's parameter scale — and a constant chosen for one
//! of those is wrong for the others.
